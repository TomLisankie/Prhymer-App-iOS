         This process:
         - needs to be random
         - selects six words at most during an iteration
         
         steps:
         - selects a random number between 0 and the size of the dictionary
         - checks to see if this index has already been examined
         - if so, it repeats this process
         - if it hasn't:
            - adds this number to another dictionary [Int: Bool]
            - finds the rhyme percentile between the initial word and the word at the index being found
            - if the RP is above 0.65, it gets added to the queue for well-rhyming ("green") words
            - otherwise, if the RP is above 0.45 but below 0.65, it gets added to the queue for mildly-rhyming ("yellow") words
            - otherwise, if it's below 0.45, it's not added to anything
         - three words from each queue are popped and listed
