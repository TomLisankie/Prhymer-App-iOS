         This process:
         - needs to be random
         - selects six words at most during an iteration
         
         steps: NEEDS to be modified to be relation based in case there aren't words that rhyme well with an input word
         - selects a random number between 0 and the size of the dictionary
         - checks to see if this index has already been examined
         - if so, it repeats this process
         - if it hasn't:
            - adds this number to another dictionary [Int: Bool]
            - finds the rhyme percentile between the initial word and the word at the index being found
            - if the RP is above 0.65, it gets added to the queue for well-rhyming ("green") words
            - otherwise, if the RP is above 0.45 but below 0.65, it gets added to the queue for mildly-rhyming ("yellow") words
            - otherwise, if it's below 0.45, it's not added to anything
         - three words from each queue are popped and listed
         -
         
         
         This process can possibly be done on multiple words to find multiple word rhyme by taking each syllable and finding words that rhyme with it.

        /*
         NEW STRATEGY:
         - compare the entered word to all the other words in the dictionary
         - as each words' spelling and their rhyme percentile with the entered word are entered into a new dictionary [String: Int], sort it by rhyme percentile
         - once this process is done, find the index at which half of the highest rhyme percentile is encountered for the first time.
         - print three of the high (green) rhyme percentile words and three of the mid (yellow).
