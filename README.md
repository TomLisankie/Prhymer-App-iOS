# Prhymer v0.4
Unfinished (and not actively being worked on) app that provides some example use cases for my [Pronunciation Similarity API](https://github.com/TomLisankie/Pronunciation-Similarity-API). Created with the goal in mind of making it easier for poets, rappers, etc. to find rhyming words and to see how well words rhyme with one another. You cannot currently save pieces, but you can find rhyming words (**NOTE:** Prhymer uses an older version of the Pronunciation Similarity API and thus it is worth noting that the percentages and rhymes may not be as nuanced or accurate as those of the newer versions) for a selected word as well as compare two words and/or phrases.

The app uses a Snapchat-like interface to swipe between views.

## Finding Rhymes

1. Click on "Suggest Rhymes" in the bottom right. ![diagram](http://tomlisankie.com/prhymer-examples/1.png "Stage 1")
2. Long press on word that you want to find rhymes for. ![diagram](http://tomlisankie.com/prhymer-examples/2.png "Stage 2")
3. Tap word that you want to insert into your writing piece. ![diagram](http://tomlisankie.com/prhymer-examples/3.png "Stage 3")

## Comparing Words/Phrases

Enter the two words/phrases that you want to compare and tap "Compare Words." A percentage will then be returned. ![diagram](http://tomlisankie.com/prhymer-examples/4.png "Stage 1")
